A year on Mercury lasts just 88 Earth days.

One solar day on Mercury—the time from one noon to the next—spans 176 Earth days, while a sidereal day (the time taken for one full rotation relative to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun, meaning its rotation has slowed over time, making it closely match its orbit. The planet also has the most eccentric orbit in the Solar System, with its distance from the Sun varying between 46 and 70 million kilometers.

Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System.

Among the five planets visible to the naked eye, Mercury has a diameter of just 4,879 kilometers at its equator, significantly smaller than Earth's 12,742 kilometers.

Mercury is the second densest planet.

Despite its small size, Mercury is extremely dense, with a density of 5.4 grams per cubic centimeter—second only to Earth. This high density results from Mercury's composition, which consists primarily of heavy metals and rock.

Mercury’s surface has wrinkles.

As its iron core cooled and contracted, Mercury's surface developed wrinkles known as lobate scarps. These features can rise up to a mile high and stretch for hundreds of miles.

Mercury has a molten core.

Recent NASA research suggests that Mercury’s core, previously thought to be solid, might actually be molten. Typically, smaller planets cool quickly and develop solid cores, but unexpected findings indicate Mercury’s core contains a lighter element like sulfur, which lowers the melting point. The core accounts for approximately 42% of Mercury’s volume, compared to Earth’s 17%.

Mercury is not the hottest planet.

Despite its proximity to the Sun, Venus is hotter due to its thick atmosphere. Mercury's sunlit side can reach temperatures of 427°C, while its dark side can drop as low as -173°C. The lack of an atmosphere prevents Mercury from regulating its temperature.

Mercury is the most cratered planet in the Solar System.

Unlike planets with geological activity that reshapes their surfaces, Mercury retains its craters, formed by impacts from asteroids and comets. Many craters are named after famous writers and artists. Any impact crater exceeding 250 kilometers in diameter is classified as a basin. The largest, the Caloris Basin, spans about 1,550 kilometers and was discovered in 1974 by the Mariner 10 probe.

Only two spacecraft have visited Mercury.

Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is a challenging destination for spacecraft. Mariner 10 flew by Mercury three times between 1974 and 1975, mapping nearly half of its surface. The next mission, the Messenger probe, launched on August 3, 2004, was the first to visit since the 1970s.

Mercury is named after the Roman messenger god.

The exact date of Mercury’s discovery is unknown, as it predates recorded history. One of the earliest known references to the planet comes from the Sumerians around 3,000 BC.

Mercury has a transient atmosphere.

With only 38% of Earth's gravity, Mercury cannot retain a stable atmosphere. Solar winds continuously strip away its thin layer of gases, but this is constantly replenished by the same solar winds, radioactive decay, and micrometeorite impacts.




A day on Venus is longer than a year.

Venus takes 243 Earth days to complete one full rotation on its axis (sidereal day), while its orbit around the Sun lasts 225 Earth days. A solar day on Venus—the time from one noon to the next—takes 117 Earth days.

Venus rotates in the opposite direction of most planets.

This retrograde rotation means Venus spins in the opposite direction of the Sun. One possible explanation is a past collision with an asteroid or another celestial object.

Venus is the second brightest object in the night sky.

Only the Moon is brighter. With a magnitude between -3.8 and -4.6, Venus is so luminous that it can be seen during daylight on a clear day.

Venus has an atmospheric pressure 92 times greater than Earth's.

This immense pressure crushes small asteroids before they reach the surface, which is why Venus has very few small craters. The pressure at Venus' surface is comparable to the pressure found deep beneath Earth's oceans.

Venus is often called Earth's sister planet.

Venus and Earth are similar in size, with only a 638-kilometer difference in diameter. Venus also has 81.5% of Earth's mass, and both planets have a central core, a molten mantle, and a crust.

The same side of Venus always faces Earth when they are at their closest.

This phenomenon may be influenced by Earth's gravitational pull.

Venus is also known as the Morning Star and the Evening Star.

Ancient civilizations once believed Venus was two separate celestial bodies. The Greeks called them Phosphorus and Hesperus, while the Romans named them Lucifer and Vesper. As Venus overtakes Earth in its orbit around the Sun, it transitions from being visible after sunset to appearing before sunrise. Mayan astronomers recorded detailed observations of Venus as early as 650 AD.

Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System.

With an average surface temperature of 462°C, Venus experiences no seasonal variations since it does not tilt on its axis. Its dense atmosphere, composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, traps heat, creating a powerful greenhouse effect.

A detailed study of Venus concluded in 2015.

In 2006, the European Space Agency launched the Venus Express spacecraft into orbit around Venus. Initially planned for a 500-day mission, it was extended multiple times before being deorbited in 2015. Scientists discovered more than 1,000 volcanoes or volcanic centers larger than 20 kilometers on Venus' surface.

The Soviet Union sent the first mission to Venus.

The Venera 1 space probe was launched in 1961 but lost contact with mission control. The USA also lost its first Venus probe, Mariner 1, but Mariner 2 successfully gathered data in 1962. The Soviet Union's Venera 3 became the first man-made craft to land on Venus in 1966.

Scientists once thought Venus might be a tropical paradise.

The thick clouds of sulfuric acid surrounding Venus prevent direct observation of its surface. Only with the development of radio mapping in the 1960s did scientists uncover its extreme temperatures and harsh environment.




The Earth's rotation is gradually slowing.

This deceleration occurs at an almost imperceptible rate of approximately 17 milliseconds per century, though the rate is not perfectly constant. As a result, days on Earth are gradually lengthening, but it would take around 140 million years for a full day to extend to 25 hours.

Earth was once thought to be the center of the universe.

Due to the apparent motion of the Sun and planets from Earth’s perspective, ancient scientists believed that Earth was stationary while other celestial bodies orbited around it. Eventually, Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model, placing the Sun at the center—though we now know even this is not the case.

Earth has a powerful magnetic field.

This magnetic field is generated by Earth's nickel-iron core and its rapid rotation. It acts as a shield, protecting the planet from the effects of solar wind.

Earth has only one natural satellite.

Relative to the size of its parent planet, the Moon is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System. However, in absolute terms, it is the fifth-largest moon overall.

Earth is the only planet not named after a god.

All other planets in the Solar System are named after Roman gods or goddesses. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were named in ancient times due to their visibility to the naked eye. The tradition continued with Uranus and Neptune after their discovery.

Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System.

Density varies across different layers of the planet, with the metallic core being significantly denser than the crust. On average, Earth's density is approximately 5.52 grams per cubic centimeter.





Mars and Earth have nearly the same land area.

Although Mars has only 15% of Earth’s volume and just over 10% of its mass, about two-thirds of Earth’s surface is covered in water. Mars has a surface gravity of just 37% of Earth’s, meaning you could jump nearly three times higher on Mars.

Mars has the tallest mountain in the solar system.

Olympus Mons, a shield volcano, stands 21 km high and spans 600 km in diameter. Despite forming over billions of years, recent lava flow evidence suggests it may still be active.

Only 18 missions to Mars have succeeded.

As of September 2014, there have been 40 missions to Mars, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, excluding flybys. Recent arrivals include NASA’s Curiosity rover in 2012, the MAVEN mission on September 22, 2014, and the Indian Space Research Organization’s MOM Mangalyaan orbiter on September 24, 2014. Upcoming missions include the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission, featuring an orbiter, lander, and rover, as well as NASA’s InSight lander, which was scheduled for launch in March 2016 with an expected arrival in September 2016.

Mars experiences the largest dust storms in the solar system.

These storms can last for months and engulf the entire planet. Mars’ extreme seasons result from its elliptical orbit, which is more elongated than that of most other planets.

On Mars, the Sun appears about half the size it does on Earth.

At its closest point to the Sun, Mars’ southern hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, causing a brief, intense summer, while the northern hemisphere experiences a short, cold winter. At its farthest point, the northern hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, leading to a long, mild summer, while the southern hemisphere undergoes a prolonged, frigid winter.

Fragments of Mars have landed on Earth.

Scientists have discovered Martian atmospheric traces in meteorites ejected from Mars. These meteorites traveled through space for millions of years before crashing onto Earth, allowing researchers to study Mars before sending space probes.

Mars is named after the Roman god of war.

The ancient Greeks called it Ares, after their war god, and the Romans followed suit, associating its blood-red color with Mars, their own god of war. Other cultures also emphasized its color—Chinese astronomers named it the "fire star," while Egyptian priests referred to it as "Her Desher" or "the red one." Mars’ red hue comes from iron-rich dust and rocks covering its surface.

There are indications of liquid water on Mars.

Mars has long been known to have water in the form of ice. The first evidence of flowing water appeared as dark streaks on crater walls and cliffs in satellite images. Due to Mars’ thin atmosphere, any present water must be salty to prevent it from freezing or evaporating.

Mars will eventually have a ring.

In 20 to 40 million years, its largest moon, Phobos, will be torn apart by gravitational forces, forming a ring that could persist for up to 100 million years.

Mars has blue sunsets.

Unlike Earth, where the sky is blue and sunsets appear red, Mars’ daytime sky is a pinkish-red, while its sunsets take on a bluish hue.






Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the solar system.
Only the Sun, Moon, and Venus shine brighter. It is one of five planets visible to the naked eye from Earth.

The ancient Babylonians were the first to document Jupiter.
Around the 7th or 8th century BC, they recorded sightings of the planet. Jupiter is named after the Roman king of the gods, while the Greeks associated it with Zeus, the god of thunder. The Mesopotamians linked it to Marduk, the patron deity of Babylon, and Germanic tribes identified it with Donar (Thor).

Jupiter has the shortest day of any planet.
It completes one full rotation every 9 hours and 55 minutes. This rapid spin causes Jupiter to bulge at the equator, giving it an oblate shape.

Jupiter takes 11.8 Earth years to orbit the Sun.
From our perspective, it moves slowly across the sky, taking months to shift between constellations.

Jupiter’s atmosphere has distinct cloud formations.
Its upper atmosphere is divided into bands of clouds made mostly of ammonia crystals, sulfur, and other compounds.

The Great Red Spot is a massive storm.
It has been raging for at least 350 years and is large enough to fit three Earths inside.

Jupiter’s interior consists of rock, metal, and hydrogen compounds.
Beneath its thick hydrogen atmosphere lie layers of compressed hydrogen gas, liquid metallic hydrogen, and a core of rock, ice, and metals.

Ganymede, Jupiter’s largest moon, is the biggest in the solar system.
Sometimes called Jovian satellites, Jupiter’s largest moons include Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa. Ganymede spans 5,268 km, making it even larger than Mercury.

Jupiter has a faint ring system.
Made primarily of dust from impacts on its smaller moons, the rings start 92,000 km above Jupiter’s cloud tops and extend beyond 225,000 km. They range from 2,000 to 12,500 km thick.

Eight spacecraft have visited Jupiter.
These include Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, Ulysses, and New Horizons. NASA’s Juno mission is en route, set to arrive in July 2016. Future missions may explore the subsurface oceans of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.





Saturn is the most distant planet visible to the naked eye.
It is the fifth brightest object in the solar system and can be easily observed with binoculars or a small telescope.

Ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians and Far Eastern observers, knew of Saturn.
The planet is named after the Roman god Saturnus, while the Greeks called it Cronus.

Saturn is the flattest planet.
Its polar diameter is only 90% of its equatorial diameter due to its low density and rapid rotation. It completes one rotation every 10 hours and 34 minutes, giving it the second-shortest day in the solar system.

Saturn takes 29.4 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.
Its slow movement against the stars earned it the Assyrian name Lubadsagush, meaning “oldest of the old.”

Saturn’s atmosphere is divided into bands of clouds.
The upper layers consist mostly of ammonia ice, while deeper layers contain water ice and mixtures of cold hydrogen and sulfur ice.

Saturn has storm systems similar to Jupiter’s.
Its north pole features a hexagonal-shaped cloud pattern, possibly caused by atmospheric waves. At its south pole, a massive hurricane-like vortex swirls.

Saturn is primarily composed of hydrogen.
The hydrogen becomes denser deeper into the planet, eventually forming metallic hydrogen. At its core lies a hot interior.

Saturn has the most extensive ring system in the solar system.
Made mostly of ice chunks with traces of carbonaceous dust, the rings extend over 120,700 km from the planet but are astonishingly thin—only about 20 meters thick.

Saturn has 150 moons and smaller moonlets.
All are frozen worlds, with Titan and Rhea being the largest. Enceladus is believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy shell.

Titan is a unique moon with a dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere.
Its surface, composed of water ice and rock, features lakes of liquid methane and landscapes coated in frozen nitrogen. Some scientists consider Titan a potential harbor for non-Earth-like life.

Four spacecraft have visited Saturn.
Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and Cassini-Huygens have all explored the planet. Cassini orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, gathering extensive data on its rings, moons, and atmosphere.

Saturn has more moons than any other planet.
The discovery of 20 new moons in 2019 brought its total to 82, surpassing Jupiter’s count.




Uranus was officially discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781.
It is too dim to have been seen by ancient astronomers. Initially, Herschel believed it was a comet, but years later, it was confirmed as a planet. He attempted to name it Georgian Sidus after King George III, but astronomer Johann Bode suggested the name Uranus, derived from the Greek deity Ouranos.

Uranus rotates once every 17 hours and 14 minutes.
It spins in a retrograde direction, opposite to Earth and most other planets.

Uranus completes one orbit around the Sun every 84 Earth years.
Due to its extreme axial tilt, its poles experience 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.

Uranus is classified as an “ice giant.”
Like the gas giants, its upper atmosphere consists of hydrogen and helium. Beneath this lies an icy mantle surrounding a rock-and-ice core. Its atmosphere contains water, ammonia, and methane ice crystals, giving Uranus its pale blue color.

Uranus experiences the coldest temperatures of any planet.
It can reach a minimum atmospheric temperature of -224°C, making it the coldest recorded in the solar system. A methane haze in its upper atmosphere hides the storms occurring in its lower cloud layers.

Uranus has two sets of thin, dark-colored rings.
These rings are composed of small particles ranging from dust to boulders. There are 11 inner rings and 2 outer rings, likely formed from shattered moons. The first rings were discovered in 1977, with the two outer rings detected by the Hubble Space Telescope between 2003 and 2005.

Uranus’ moons are named after literary characters.
The moons are named after figures from William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope’s works, including Oberon, Titania, and Miranda. Most are frozen worlds with dark surfaces, and Miranda is particularly unique, featuring ice canyons, terraces, and bizarre surface formations.

Only one spacecraft has visited Uranus.
In 1986, Voyager 2 flew past Uranus at a distance of 81,500 km, capturing the first close-up images of the planet, its rings, and its moons.





Neptune was not known to the ancients.
It is not visible to the naked eye and was first observed in 1846. Its position was predicted mathematically before its discovery. Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea.

Neptune rotates rapidly on its axis.
Its equatorial clouds complete one full rotation in just 16 hours. This rapid spin occurs because Neptune is a gaseous planet, not a solid body.

Neptune is the smallest of the ice giants.
Despite being smaller than Uranus, it has a greater mass. Beneath its dense atmosphere, Neptune consists of hydrogen, helium, and methane gases, surrounding layers of water, ammonia, and methane ice. Its core is made of rock.

Neptune's atmosphere is primarily hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane.
The methane absorbs red light, giving Neptune its distinctive deep blue color. High, wispy clouds drift in its upper atmosphere.

Neptune has a highly active climate.
Massive storms rage through its atmosphere, with winds reaching up to 600 meters per second (2,160 km/h). One of the most famous storms, the Great Dark Spot, was observed in 1989 and lasted about five years.

Neptune has a faint ring system.
Its rings are composed of ice particles mixed with dust and possibly coated with carbon-based material.

Neptune has 14 known moons.
The most notable is Triton, a frozen world that spews nitrogen ice and dust from beneath its surface. Triton is thought to have been captured by Neptune’s gravity and is likely the coldest known world in the solar system.

Only one spacecraft has visited Neptune.
In 1989, Voyager 2 flew past Neptune, providing the first close-up images of the planet and its moons. The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and various ground-based observatories have since continued studying Neptune.
